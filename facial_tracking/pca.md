## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### What is it?

Principal components analysis (PCA) is a technique that can be used to simplify a dataset. It reduces dimensions to two by eliminating principal components that have small variance, defining a new coordinate system. You can find a great explanation on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ). It covers basic terms like eigenvectors and eigenvalues and gives a basic understanding of the algorithm.
